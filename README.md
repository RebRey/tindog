Bootstrap helps websites to become more responsive (responds to the viewport). A better word to use instead of responsive is adaptable layout. If you're looking at the same website on mobile or on iPad or on Desktop, it should have a different layout to be able to best take advantage of the size of the screen real estate.

In digital marketing, a landing page is a standalone web page, created specifically for a marketing or advertising campaign. It’s where a visitor “lands” after they click on a link in an email, or ads from Google, Bing, YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, or similar places on the web.  Unlike web pages, which typically have many goals and encourage exploration, landing pages are designed with a single focus or goal, known as a call to action (or CTA, for short).  It’s this focus that makes landing pages the best option for increasing the conversion rates of your marketing campaigns and lowering your cost of acquiring a lead or sale.
